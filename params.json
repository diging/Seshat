{"name":"Seshat","tagline":"","body":"### What?\r\n> In Egyptian mythology, Seshat (also spelled Safkhet, Sesat, Seshet, Sesheta, and Seshata) was the Ancient Egyptian goddess of wisdom, knowledge, and writing. She was seen as a **scribe and record keeper**, and her name means she who scrivens (i.e. she who is the scribe), and is credited with inventing writing. She also became identified as the goddess of architecture, astronomy, astrology, building, mathematics, and surveying. These are all professions that relied upon expertise in her skills. She is identified as Safekh-Aubi in some late texts.\r\n\r\n> **Mistress of the House of Books** is another title for Seshat, being the deity whose priests oversaw the library in which scrolls of the most important knowledge were assembled and spells were preserved. One prince of the fourth dynasty, Wep-em-nefret, is noted as the Overseer of the Royal Scribes, Priest of Seshat on a slab stela. Heliopolis was the location of her principal sanctuary. She is described as the **goddess of history**.\r\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seshat)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nErick Peirson (@erickpeirson)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nTough luck.","google":"UA-40113626-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
